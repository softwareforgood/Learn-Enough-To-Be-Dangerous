## Testing — Ruby on Rails

### Different testing tools
There are a handful of tools that you can use to test your Rails app. These are a couple that we have used at SfG:

### Minitest
This is the testing suite that comes with Rails by default. You can check out the documentation for working with Minitest and Rails [here](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html).

### Basic RSpec
This is a testing suite you can add to Rails with this [gem](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails#rspec-rails--).
[Here](https://rspec.info/documentation/) are RSpec's official docs

#### Some RSpec related tooling
1. Using Factory Bot makes testing easier. [Here](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/working-effectively-with-data-factories-using-factorybot) and [here](https://medium.com/craft-academy/introduction-to-ruby-and-rspec-135da4051802) are a couple of Factory Bot tutorials.
