## Testing â€” JavaScript

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) is a tool often used to write JavaScript tests. With this, you can build tests for different kinds of projects like ReactJS, Typescript, etc.

Other popular JS testing suites include [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) and [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).

### ReactJS Testing
While Jest can be used with ReactJS, if you want to use tools more specific to testing React components, here are some commonly used libraries that are pretty well documented: 
* [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/), which is more lightweight
* [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/), which allows for more internal testing of components
