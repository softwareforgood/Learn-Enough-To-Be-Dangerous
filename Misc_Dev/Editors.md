# Editors
Editors are where we write code. There are various types of editors out there. It isn't extremely important which type of editor you use, so use whatever works for you.

## Integrated Development Environments
RubyMine, IntelliJ, Eclipse

## Sublime Text, Atom, Visual Studio Code, Notebook++
These are relatively more accessible editors. The differences between these usually don't matter to a new programmer. Just focus on coding more generally and you'll pick up cool tricks along the way.

## VI, VIM, Emacs, Nano
These editors are very powerful, but can have a steeper learning curve. If you are going to have a career as a developer, and especially if you want to work in the 'backend', you'll need to be competent in at least one of these. The differences between these usually don't matter to a new programmer.

These editors have a steep learning curve so you'll need to spend some time patiently figuring out the basics. You may eventually find these to be more powerful and these become your goto editor. There are helpful tutorials like [This Interactive Vim Tutorial](http://www.openvim.com/) and fun games like [Vim Adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/) to help you in the early stages.
