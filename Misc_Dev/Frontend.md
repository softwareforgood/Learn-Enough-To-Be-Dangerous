Documentation: [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/TAgs/default.asp) and [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) are both reliable sources.

Tutorials: [HTML Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#html-foundations) and [CSS Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#css-foundations) are great. Optionally, a deeper dive into CSS's [Flexbox](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#flexbox). Skim over topics as needed.

# CSS

- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and other preprocessors are libraries designed to make writing CSS easier.
  - Sass allows developers to use [variables, nesting, imports](http://sass-lang.com/guide) and other conveniences.
- Flexbox is a css framework.
  - [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) is not official documentation for Flexbox, but super helpful when you're starting out.
  - [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) is a fun game to help you learn Flexbox
